üß† AI Usage Report ‚Äì ADmyBRAND Insights Dashboard
While building the ADmyBRAND Insights Dashboard, I wanted to create something not just functional but also modern and visually appealing. I chose Next.js with TypeScript as the foundation and integrated Tailwind CSS and Recharts for styling and data visualization. Since this was my first time working with this particular stack, I relied on multiple resources  including AI (ChatGPT)  to speed up the development process and overcome roadblocks.

üë®‚Äçüíª My Development Journey
I began by planning the basic structure: the dashboard needed to display revenue, user metrics, conversion rates, and a few charts. I had a good idea of what I wanted visually (dark-themed UI, animated transitions, responsive layout), and I set out to implement it.

While I handled the folder setup and component logic myself, I referred to ChatGPT at certain points especially when:

I needed help setting up Tailwind CSS with Next.js and enabling dark/light theme toggling.

I ran into module errors and needed guidance on resolving import path issues.

I wanted to add smooth animations with framer-motion and wasn‚Äôt sure how to structure the transitions.

I was unsure about how to deploy properly on Vercel, and needed help setting up GitHub integration cleanly (especially during a merge conflict).

Each time, I used AI not as a crutch, but as a second brain ‚Äî helping me understand what was wrong, and then write or refactor code based on that knowledge.

üß† How AI Assisted Me
It suggested structure for components like StatCard, AnalyticsCharts, and ThemeToggle, which I modified to fit the layout I envisioned.

When the light mode wasn‚Äôt working, I asked for a breakdown of the ThemeProvider and global styles, and fixed it with the help of the explanation.

During Git and Vercel deployment, AI helped me understand the steps and commands rather than just giving them ‚Äî I learned the reasoning behind things like git pull --allow-unrelated-histories and .gitignore conflicts.

‚ú® Final Thoughts
While AI was a helpful coding partner, I made the decisions about UI/UX, project structure, theming, and styling based on my own ideas. This dashboard reflects a blend of my vision and efficient problem-solving using AI where needed.

The end result is a polished, responsive, and animated dashboard that I‚Äôm proud to have built ‚Äî and the process gave me deeper confidence in using Next.js and modern frontend tools.
